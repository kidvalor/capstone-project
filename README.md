 Welcome to Mixtape Maker! 
 
 This Full Stack CRUD app was designed to bring Music lovers closer together by showing you what you and your family and friends are listening to. 
 
 You can use Mixtape Maker to build playlist using Music from services including Pandora, Apple Music, and Spotify and share it with friends. 
 
 Want to know what your close friends are listening to? Mixtape Maker provides listening Data to show you what songs your fiends are listening to most so when you are building playlist you can offer the best social mix around.
